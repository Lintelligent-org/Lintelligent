# prompt-builder.agent.md — Changelog

- 2026-01-18: Applied suggested edits to the agent guidance (in-files):
  - Deduplicated tools list in frontmatter.
  - Relaxed XML-only markup requirement; allow Markdown code fences for examples.
  - Added short scan-friendly summaries for Research, Testing, and Improvement phases.
  - Added minimal `Prompt Builder` and `Prompt Tester` example blocks demonstrating expected outputs.
  - Introduced concrete validation scenarios with explicit pass/fail criteria.
  - Adjusted imperative-terms guidance to require imperative language for action items while permitting explanatory prose.

When updating the main agent file, append brief changelog entries here with date and rationale.
